# Ethersecret-scanner
An automated scanner for ethersecret addresses

EtherSecret Scanner is an autonomous scanner for the EtherSecret website (www.ethersecret.com).

The EtherSecret website is a project where people have generated the **entire keyspace of possible private keys** for ethereum (based on SHA-256) which gave all the possible 2^256(115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936) keys.

This program automatically scraps pages looking for positive balance accounts.

Note that the chances of actually finding an account are very tiny.
